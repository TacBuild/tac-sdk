# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New assets module: added classes/utilities for working with assets (`FT`, `NFT`, `TON`), `AssetFactory`, `AssetCache`, and export indexes.
- New SDK components: `Configuration`, `Logger` (`ConsoleLogger`/`NoopLogger`), `Simulator`, `TransactionManager`, `TxFinalizer`, `Validator`.
- Debug mode for `TacSDK` and `OperationTracker`: SDK and OperationTracker don't write to console by default.
- Optional waiting for operation resolution in `TacSDK` and `OperationTracker` while using `waitOptions` argument.
- RetryableContractOpener for stable work of SDK
- Check balance before sending crosschain transaction.
- `RawSender` can send transactions in batches(size is 254 for W5, 4 for others).
- Check for transaction tree success on TON using `TonTxFinalizer`.

### Changed

- Sender and adapter updates: refactored `BatchSender`/`RawSender`/`TonConnectSender`, `contractOpener` and `retryableContractOpener`.
- Errors and structs: updated errors (errors/*), structs (structs/*), utilities (Utils.ts), operation tracker (OperationTracker), StartTracking.
- Documentation: added/updated SDK pages (assets, logger, simulator, transaction_manager, utilities, etc.).
- Tests: reorganization â€” removed/replaced some tests (e.g., tests/operation_tracker/tracker.spec.ts, tests/unit/getTokenAddress.spec.ts), added new unit tests (operation-tracker.spec.ts, validator.spec.ts) and updated integration scenarios.
- Methods in `OperationTracker` and `sendCrossChainTransaction(s)` in `TacSDK` now accept optional `waitOptions` argument. Example:

```typescript
async getOperationStatus(operationId: string, waitOptions?: WaitOptions<StatusInfo>)
```
